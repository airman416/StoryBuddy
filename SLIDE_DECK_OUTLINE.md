## üé® Design Guidelines

### Colors:
- **Primary:** Soft pastels (light blue, pink, yellow) - child-friendly
- **Accent:** Bright but not harsh (orange, teal)
- **Text:** Dark gray (not black) for readability
- **Background:** White or very light cream

### Fonts:
- **Headlines:** Rounded, friendly sans-serif (Quicksand, Nunito, Poppins)
- **Body:** Clean sans-serif (Inter, Open Sans, Roboto)
- **Size:** Large - judges need to read from distance

### Icons:
- Use emojis liberally - they're on-brand and universal
- Or use simple line icons from Heroicons, Feather, or similar
- Keep them consistent in style

### Layout:
- **Lots of white space** - don't cram
- **One main idea per slide**
- **No more than 3 bullets per slide**
- **Images > Text** when possible

## üö® Common Slide Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Put paragraphs of text on slides
- Use tiny fonts (< 24pt)
- Include every technical detail
- Have more than 12 slides
- Read directly from slides
- Use cheesy stock photos
- Overuse animations/transitions

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Keep text minimal (headlines + bullets)
- Use large, readable fonts (32-48pt)
- Focus on key points
- Keep it under 10 slides
- Use slides as visual aids, not scripts
- Use your actual app screenshots
- Keep transitions simple (fade or none)

---

## üéØ Alternative: Minimal Slide Approach

**If you want to go ultra-minimal (recommended for hackathons):**

### 5 Slides Only:
1. **Title** - Who you are, what you built
2. **Problem** - Why this matters
3. **DEMO** - Title card, then switch to live app
4. **How It Works** - Gemini + ElevenLabs + Architecture
5. **Thank You** - Closing

Then spend **3.5 minutes on live demo** and talking, 30 seconds per slide.

**Why this works:**
- Forces you to focus on the demo (which is impressive)
- Judges see the actual product more
- Less time making slides, more time polishing the app
- Confidence comes from knowing your product, not your slides

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Have a backup plan:** Export slides as PDF in case internet fails
2. **Test on presentation computer:** Fonts and layouts can shift
3. **Use presenter notes:** Keep your talking points there, not on slides
4. **Practice transitions:** Know when to advance slides
5. **End on demo not slides:** If time allows, show app again during Q&A

---

## üéì Final Advice

**Your app is the star, not your slides.**

Slides should support your story, not tell it for you. Keep them visual, keep them simple, and spend most of your time showing StoryBuddy in action.

The judges will remember:
- How the app works (demo)
- How you explain the tech (your words)
- Whether they'd use it (value prop)

They won't remember:
- Fancy slide transitions
- Exact bullet point wording
- Complex diagrams

**Make slides in 30 minutes. Polish the demo for 3 hours. That's the winning formula.**

Good luck! üöÄ
